List vs Tuple 
The main differences between lists and tuples are:

1.Lists are mutable, while tuples are immutable.

2.Lists are represented using square brackets [], while tuples are represented using parentheses ().

3.Lists are typically used for collections of items that may change over time, while tuples are typically used for collections of related items that should not change.

functions Vs methods
The main differences between functions and methods are:

1.Functions are stand-alone blocks of code, while methods are associated with objects.

2.Functions are defined using the def keyword, while methods are defined inside a class definition.

3.Functions can be called using the function name, while methods are called on objects using the dot notation.
