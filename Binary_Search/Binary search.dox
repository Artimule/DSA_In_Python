Binary Search : Explained
Let’s consider this simple problem statement: You are given an array of integers and a key element, your task is to search for the key in the given array.

One simple approach you can follow is to traverse through the entire array and while traversing compare every element with the key, if the key is a match with current array element then you are done with your task. 

But what if the given array length is very large? If you check every element with a key then it will take more time which is not optimal.

So, to optimise the search operation we will use “Binary Search”, that is an algorithm for searching and uses the “Divide and Conquer” technique.
