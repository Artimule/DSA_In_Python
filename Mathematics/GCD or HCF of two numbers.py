'''GCD or HCF of two numbers

Given two numbers. The task is to find the GCD of the two numbers.

In Python, the math module contains a number of mathematical operations, which can be performed with ease using the module. math.gcd() function compute the greatest common divisor of 2 numbers mentioned in its arguments.

Syntax: math.gcd(x, y)
Parameter:
x : Non-negative integer whose gcd has to be computed.
y : Non-negative integer whose gcd has to be computed.
Returns: An absolute/positive integer value after calculating 
 the GCD of given parameters x and y.
Exceptions: When Both x and y are 0, function returns 0, 
 If any number is a character, Type error is raised.'''
# Python code to demonstrate the working of gcd()
# importing "math" for mathematical operations
import math

# prints 12
print("The gcd of 60 and 48 is : ", end="")
print(math.gcd(60, 48))

# Output
# The gcd of 60 and 48 is : 12
# Using Euclidean Algorithm :

# The Euclidâ€™s algorithm (or Euclidean Algorithm) is a method for efficiently finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The GCD of two integers X and Y is the largest number that divides both of X and Y (without leaving a remainder).

# Pseudo Code of the Algorithm-

# Let  a, b  be the two numbers
# a mod b = R
# Let  a = b  and  b = R
# Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until  a mod b  is greater than 0
# GCD = b
#  Finish
# Recursive function to return gcd of a and b
def gcd(a, b):

	# Everything divides 0
	if (a == 0):
		return b
	if (b == 0):
		return a

	# base case
	if (a == b):
		return a

	# a is greater
	if (a > b):
		return gcd(a-b, b)
	return gcd(a, b-a)

# Driver program to test above function
a = 98
b = 56
if(gcd(a, b)):
	print('GCD of', a, 'and', b, 'is', gcd(a, b))
else:
	print('not found')
 

# Output

# GCD of 98 and 56 is 14
# Using Optimised Euclidean Algorithm :

def hcf(a, b):
	if(b == 0):
		return a
	else:
		return hcf(b, a % b)

a = 60
b = 48

# prints 12
print("The gcd of 60 and 48 is : ", end="")
print(hcf(60, 48))
 

# Output
# The gcd of 60 and 48 is : 12
